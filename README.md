# Spring Service Code Kata

This project contains a coding exercise focusing on implementing logic in the service layer of a backend micro-service.
The test resources contains a `CatalogServiceTest` with pre-defined tests to verify the behavior of the corresponding service `CatalogService`.
The `CatalogService` only contains method stubs which will result in the tests to fail.  The goal of the exercise is to implement login the service so that all the tests pass.
